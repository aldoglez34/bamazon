# Bamazon

Bamazon is an app to manage an online store. It consists of two different files:

* A customer app
* A management app



## Customer app (bamazonCustomer.js)

This is the one you execute if you want to buy in Bamazon, it shows all the items in the database (if they are 0 stock they won't show), along with their price, department and stock. The process is simple, you just select the id of the item you'd like to purchase and the quantity, the app will show you the total of your purchase.
